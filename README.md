A custom implementation of a simplied printf() function, employing variadic functions to handle various format specifiers.

## Features

- **Variadic Format Handling:** Supports a variable number of arguments using variadic functions.
- **Format Specifiers:** Supports commonly used format specifiers for printf():
    - **%c:**        Character
    - **%s:**        String
    - **%p:**        Pointer
    - **%d, %i:**    Decimal (signed)
    - **%u:** Usigned Decimal
    - **%x, %X:** Hexadecimal
    - **%%:** Percentage Sign
 - **Inclusion of Libft:** Leverages existing Libft functions to enhance code reusability, minimize redundancies, and ensure project coherence.
 - **Error Handling:** Manages invalid input formats in a controlled way.

## Variadic Functions
Variadic functions, also known as variable argument functions, allow users to pass different types and numbers of arguments to the function. Let's have a closer look at ft_printf() to understand this better:

- **Prototype:** `int ft_printf(const char *format, ...)`
    - `int`: The function's return type, representing the number of characters printed, including newline characters, excluding NULL terminators (or '-1' in case of an error).
    - `const char *`: A pointer to the 'format string', which contains the content to be printed as well as format specifiers, working as placeholders.
    - `...`: The ellipsis (-> intentional omission of text) indicates that further arguments of any type and number can be accepted (also none). In the context of `ft_printf()`, variables replacing the format specifiers in the format string are expected here.
    - **Example Usage:**
      ```c
      int result = ft_printf("Hello, %s! You scored %d points.\n", "Betty", 42);
        // 'result' contains the number of characters printed by ft_printf -> 36
      ```
        - In the printout, variable arguments "Betty" (char *) and 42 (int) will be formatted by and replaced with the format specifiers %s and %d, respectively.
- **Variadic Macros:**
    - `va_list`: Is a data type representing a list of arguments, commonly used as a parameter for variadic functions. The variable 'args' used below is of this type.
    - `va_start(args, format)`: Initializes the va_list 'args' to point to the first variable argument, which are found right after the 'format' string (`int ft_printf(const char *format, ...)`).
    - `va_arg(args, type)`: Retrieves the next argument from the va_list 'args' using the specified type, allowing you to iterate through the 'va_list' by calling this function repeatedly, similar to the concept of iterating through lines with [get_next_line()](https://github.com/alx-sch/42_get_next_line).
    - `va_end(args)`: Cleans up the 'va_list' and should be called before the function returns.
 
## Error Handling 
It's important to note that the behavior of printf() is not defined in certain edge cases, such as invalid format or argument input, and can vary depending on the platform it's executed on. For instance, I observed the following differences:

| Case | Command | Printout (Ubuntu) | Printout (macOS) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NULL pointer | `printf("->%p", (void*)ptr);`| `->(nil)` (Return: 7) | `->0x0` (Return: 5) |
| Invalid specifier | `printf("->%k", nbr);` | `->%k` (Return: 4) | `->k` (Return: 3) |
| % at EOF | `printf("->%");` | `->` (Return: -1) | `->` (Return: 2) |
| Space(s) between % and EOF | `printf("->%   ");` | `->` (Return: -1) | `->` (Return: 2) |
| Space(s) between % and invalid spec. | `printf("->%   k");` | `->% k` (Return: 5) | `->k` (Return: 3) |

With the following specifications:
 ```bash (64-bit)
 # Ubutnu (v. 22.04) / x86_64
 gcc --version
 gcc (Ubuntu 10.5.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 10.5.0
```
 ```bash
 # macOS: Darwin (v. 23.3.0) / x86_64 (64-bit)
 gcc --version
 Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.1.0.2.5)
```
I have implemented the error returns as generated by printf() on Ubuntu into my project. The function check_error() checks if an encountered '%' in the format string is at the EOF or is exclusively followed by space characters. It stops printing and returns '-1' if that's the case.

Regarding the representation of NULL pointers, I decided to print '(nil)'. Other edge cases were not explicitly considered.

## Testing
Several test cases, which compare the printout and return values of ft_printf() with those of the native printf(), are available in 'test_ft_printf.c'. After compiling the project's library, create the test program using the command `cc -o TEST test_ft_printf.c libftprintf.a`.

Note: The 'incomplete format specifier' warnings for printf() are expected as this is part of the testing process; please go ahead and ignore these.
